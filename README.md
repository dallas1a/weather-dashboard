In this application a user is presented with Hartford as the default city for a weather display that gives the days current weather as well as a 5 day forecast. It uses one call api to get the Temperature/Humidity/UV index/ wind conditions and how it feels. The current day is more detailed than the forecast. The UV index is also given a color based on the severity the number represents in potential damage. There is a search bar that allows a user to look up the weather conditions for a different city and is then given that cities weather, after a city has been searched it is saved to local storage using JSON and is put in a list as a clickable button that can be used to search the city again without needing to type the search parameters again.
